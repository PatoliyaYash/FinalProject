        <div id="accordion">
            <h3>Are there places in the Park to store my belongings?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Convenient locker facilities are available at Canada's Wonderland, located at the Front Gate adjacent
                    to the Canada's Wonderland Store and at the entrance of Splash Works. Locker rental fees for all-day
                    access range from $17 to $30, depending on the size of the locker and the current season. <br/><br/>Please
                    note that seasonal pricing may apply. While lockers provide a secure storage solution, Canada's
                    Wonderland assumes no liability for items stored within. Guests are encouraged to choose the
                    appropriate locker size, keep their locker receipt safe, and consider sharing lockers to split
                    costs. Enjoy your visit with peace of mind knowing your belongings are safely stored away!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Am I permitted to bring my own food and beverages into the Park?</h3>

            <h3>Are strollers or wheelchairs available for rent?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>For our guests' convenience, we offer single and double strollers for a one-day rental. All rentals

                    one-day rental. It is recommended that guests bring their own wheelchairs. Visit our rentals page to
                    see the wheelchair options.

            <h3>What happens in bad weather?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Rides will close due to extreme temperatures and adverse weather conditions - particularly heavy
                    rain, high winds and/or lightning. This is to ensure that the safety of all our guests is not
                    compromised in unpredictable weather. <br/><br/>Please be assured that Canada's Wonderland makes every effort
                    to reopen the rides as quickly and safely as possible after the adverse weather conditions cease. No
                    refunds or rainchecks will be issued due to adverse weather conditions.</p>
